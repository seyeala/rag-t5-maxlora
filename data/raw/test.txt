Administrative Rules and Procedures (ARP) – New Mexico State University

Overview
--------
According to the NMSU policy hub, the Administrative Rules and Procedures (ARP) is the collection of operational policies for the NMSU system.  It consists of rules and procedures that are developed through a formal review and approval process authorized by the Board of Regents (see Regents Policy Manual 1.10)https://arp.nmsu.edu/#:~:text=The%20Administrative%20Rules%20and%20Procedures,President%20to%20approve%20or%20disapprove.  The purpose of the ARP is to communicate the operational policies that implement the Regents’ overarching policies and to promote efficient and effective management while honoring shared governancehttps://arp.nmsu.edu/#:~:text=The%20Administrative%20Rules%20and%20Procedures,President%20to%20approve%20or%20disapprove.  In the event of any inconsistency between the ARP and the Regents Policy Manual (RPM), the RPM is controllinghttps://arp.nmsu.edu/#:~:text=principles%20of%20shared%20governance,and%20students%2C%20unless%20otherwise%20indicated.

**Note regarding content**: The ARP consists of more than one hundred detailed rules spread across eighteen chapters.  Compiling every rule verbatim into a single document would produce a very large file.  To make the document usable, this compilation lists all chapters and their rule titles and provides the full text of one rule (ARP 6.01 – Hiring) as an example.  Readers seeking the full text of other rules should consult the official ARP website.  Each rule title below corresponds to a rule page on the NMSU site.

The ARP is organized by chapter, and each chapter contains numerous rules.  Below is a compilation of all chapters and their associated rules as listed on the ARP website in October 2025.  Only the section headings are provided here, except for ARP 6.01 whose full text appears at the end of this document.

This rule states that New Mexico State University is committed to maintaining the highest standards of ethics and integrity in all academic and administrative operations. Members of the university community—including regents, administrators, faculty, staff, students and others acting on behalf of the university or university‑controlled entities—are expected to exercise personal and professional honesty, respect the rights and contributions of others and comply with applicable laws, regulations, contract requirements and university policieshttps://arp.nmsu.edu/chapter-3/3-00.html#:~:text=Inherent%20within%20the%20responsibility%20for,appropriate%20for%20a%20public%20institution. Individuals must never use or disclose confidential, proprietary or private information except where authorized or legally obligated, must avoid real or potential conflicts of interest and commitment between personal and professional responsibilities and must prioritize the university’s interests in decision‑makinghttps://arp.nmsu.edu/chapter-3/3-00.html#:~:text=3,university%20have%20a%20responsibility%20to. University assets may not be used for illegal purposes or personal gain, and members must strive to present all information, including financial and research data, completely and accuratelyhttps://arp.nmsu.edu/chapter-3/3-00.html#:~:text=ensure%20that%20funds%20and%20other,and%20research%20data%20and%20results. The rule’s revision history notes that it was part of the 2017 recompilation, formerly Rules 3.19.10 and 3.19.20https://arp.nmsu.edu/chapter-3/3-00.html#:~:text=Related.

**Policy Details**: Responsible Executive – University General Counsel; Responsible Administrator – Director, Office of People Relations; Scope – NMSU System; Last Updated – 09/08/2005https://arp.nmsu.edu/chapter-3/3-01.html#:~:text=Policy%20Details.

This rule emphasizes that individuals who have concerns about the propriety of a situation or the conduct of a university employee or someone acting on behalf of the university are expected to consult with appropriate university officials. It provides examples of the appropriate points of contact (such as the supervisor of the person whose conduct is in question, the chair of the Committee on Conflicts of Interest in Sponsored Activities or the university president when a regent is involved)https://arp.nmsu.edu/chapter-3/3-01.html#:~:text=Individuals%20who%20have%20concerns%20about,maintained%20whenever%20possible%20and%20employees. The rule assures that confidentiality will be maintained whenever possible and that employees shall be free from retaliation for voicing concernshttps://arp.nmsu.edu/chapter-3/3-01.html#:~:text=involved%2C%20the%20President%29,from%20retaliation%20for%20voicing%20concerns. The revision history indicates that this rule derives from the 2017 recompilation, formerly Rule 3.19.30https://arp.nmsu.edu/chapter-3/3-01.html#:~:text=Related.

### Full text of ARP 3.02 – Principles, Definitions and Examples relating to Conflict of Interest/Commitment

**Policy Details**: Responsible Executive – University General Counsel; Responsible Administrator – Director, Office of People Relations; Scope – NMSU System; Last Updated – 09/08/2005https://arp.nmsu.edu/chapter-3/3-02.html#:~:text=Interest%2FCommitment.

This lengthy rule outlines the principles and definitions used to identify and manage conflicts of interest or commitment.

**Part 1: Principles.** Members of the university community and affiliated entities must recognize and resolve conflicts of interest or commitment. Conflicts may be financial, personal or institutional. Three general principles guide the response: disclose always, manage when possible and prohibit when necessaryhttps://arp.nmsu.edu/chapter-3/3-02.html#:~:text=PART%201%3A%20PRINCIPLES. Disclosure requires individuals to accurately complete conflict‑of‑interest forms and update them when circumstances change; management often involves recusal from decision‑making to remove or isolate the conflict; prohibition applies when management is impossible or forbidden by law, for example prohibiting regents from acting as vendors to the universityhttps://arp.nmsu.edu/chapter-3/3-02.html#:~:text=PART%201%3A%20PRINCIPLES.

**Part 2: Definitions and Illustrations.** This part provides definitions and examples to aid employees and review bodies in identifying conflicts. A conflict of commitment arises when external activities detract from one’s capacity to meet NMSU responsibilities. Examples of conflicts of commitment include maintaining full‑time paid employment elsewhere that interferes with attendance, excessive private consulting or advisory service, or holding elective political officehttps://arp.nmsu.edu/chapter-3/3-02.html#:~:text=A. Permitted activities include limited consulting, serving on professional committees or editing journals when these do not interfere with workhttps://arp.nmsu.edu/chapter-3/3-02.html#:~:text=2,but%20are%20not%20limited%20to.

Conflicts of interest occur when private interests compete with professional obligations such that an independent observer might question whether decisions are based on anything other than NMSU’s interestshttps://arp.nmsu.edu/chapter-3/3-02.html#:~:text=B. Examples include having a significant financial interest in a concern competing with NMSU, procuring goods or services from a business owned by a university official or family member, or reviewing proposals from family membershttps://arp.nmsu.edu/chapter-3/3-02.html#:~:text=1,but%20are%20not%20limited%20to. Permitted activities include serving as investigator on multi‑institutional projects or allowing access to NMSU resources as part of licensing agreementshttps://arp.nmsu.edu/chapter-3/3-02.html#:~:text=2,part%20of%20statutory%20permitted%20activities.

The rule further defines terms such as investigator (any person responsible for design, conduct or reporting of a sponsored activity)https://arp.nmsu.edu/chapter-3/3-02.html#:~:text=C; member of the university community (regents, students, employees and others acting for NMSU)https://arp.nmsu.edu/chapter-3/3-02.html#:~:text=D,Community; relationship (family members, close friends, business partners)https://arp.nmsu.edu/chapter-3/3-02.html#:~:text=For%20purposes%20of%20this%20Rule%2C,mean%20and%20include%20the%20following; and significant financial interest (anything of monetary value owned or payable to a faculty or staff member, including compensation exceeding $10,000, equity interests exceeding $10,000 or 5 % ownership, intellectual property rights, stipends, scholarships and gifts exceeding $100)https://arp.nmsu.edu/chapter-3/3-02.html#:~:text=F. It defines “sponsored activity” as a project with identifiable objectives for which external funding or other support is requested or receivedhttps://arp.nmsu.edu/chapter-3/3-02.html#:~:text=G.

**Related/Cross References.** The rule cross‑references ARP 3.03 (Continuing Duty to Disclose Conflicts), ARP 6.90 (Outside Employment or Activities), ARP 6.91 (Staff Consulting) and ARP 6.92 (Faculty Consulting). The revision history notes that the rule derives from the 2017 recompilation (formerly Rules 3.20.10 and 3.20.20–3.20.28)https://arp.nmsu.edu/chapter-3/3-02.html#:~:text=Related.

### Full text of ARP 3.03 – Continuing Duty to Disclose Conflicts; Paths Toward Remedies

**Policy Details**: Responsible Executive – University General Counsel; Responsible Administrator – Director, Office of People Relations; Scope – NMSU System; Last Updated – 07/20/2010https://arp.nmsu.edu/chapter-3/3-03.html#:~:text=Policy%20Details.

This rule establishes the continuing duty of NMSU personnel to report any real, apparent or potential conflict of interest or commitment to their supervisors. Individuals must complete a Conflict of Interest Disclosure Form upon hire, when new conflicts arise and annually. Forms containing no conflicts require one level of review and approval, whereas those identifying conflicts require two levels of review and submission of a plan to manage or eliminate the conflicthttps://arp.nmsu.edu/chapter-3/3-03.html#:~:text=PART%201%3A%20PROCEDURE. Conflicts may be reviewed by the Committee on Conflicts of Interest in Sponsored Activities. Records are maintained by the Office of Human Resource Serviceshttps://arp.nmsu.edu/chapter-3/3-03.html#:~:text=submitted%20may%20be%20reviewed%20by,Office%20of%20Human%20Resource%20Services.

**Part 2: Remedies for Conflicts.** The rule explains that the path toward remedying a conflict depends on whether it arises from a sponsored activity and whether the conflict was self‑disclosed or reported by someone else. Conflicts in non‑sponsored activities follow normal personnel procedures (referencing ARP 3.25 and ARP 10.01), while conflicts in sponsored activities follow the procedures in ARP 3.11https://arp.nmsu.edu/chapter-3/3-03.html#:~:text=1,from%20sponsored%20activities%20shall%20be. Self‑disclosed conflicts are generally managed through measures such as recusal or withdrawal from the activity; conflicts reported by others may require withdrawal from the activity and potential repayment of funds, with possible disciplinary sanctionshttps://arp.nmsu.edu/chapter-3/3-03.html. The revision history notes a 2010 amendment and that the rule was formerly Rule 3.20.15https://arp.nmsu.edu/chapter-3/3-03.html#:~:text=Related.

This rule addresses potential conflicts when NMSU faculty or staff enroll in degree or certificate programs at NMSU. Persons pursuing degrees or certificates must demonstrate that their dual role as student and employee will not compromise the quality of their program of study. Approval from cognizant department heads and deans is required, and supervisors should not have responsibility for grading individuals whom they supervisehttps://arp.nmsu.edu/chapter-3/3-05.html#:~:text=When%20a%20university%20faculty%20or,grading%20individuals%20whom%20they%20supervise. Graduate programs must also be approved by the dean of the Graduate School with concurrence of the provost; the dean may require an independent representative on the graduate committee to manage conflictshttps://arp.nmsu.edu/chapter-3/3-05.html#:~:text=In%20the%20case%20of%20graduate,a%20condition%20for%20approving%20programs. The rule is a 2017 recompilation of former Rule 3.20.33https://arp.nmsu.edu/chapter-3/3-05.html#:~:text=Related.

### Full text of ARP 3.06 – Relatives and Significant Other

NMSU faculty must avoid situations in which they supervise, evaluate, teach or grade the work of family members or individuals with whom they have a consensual relationship. If such a situation arises, the department head and dean (or equivalent) must approve a plan to manage the conflicthttps://arp.nmsu.edu/chapter-3/3-06.html#:~:text=Faculty%20of%20NMSU%20may%20not,members%20of%20the%20supervisors%E2%80%99%20family. Supervisors must take similar precautions when faculty they supervise teach members of the supervisor’s family. The revision history identifies this rule as a 2017 recompilation of former Rule 3.20.34https://arp.nmsu.edu/chapter-3/3-06.html#:~:text=Cross.

### Full text of ARP 3.07 – Participation in Committees

**Policy Details**: Responsible Executive – Vice President Administration and Finance; Responsible Administrator – AVP Human Resource Services; Scope – NMSU System; Last Updated – 09/08/2005https://arp.nmsu.edu/chapter-3/3-07.html#:~:text=Policy%20Details.

Conflicts of interest may arise during routine committee service when the committee member has a close relationship with a person under consideration. Individuals should recuse themselves when such conflicts exist. Examples include serving on employment selection committees when a family member, friend or close professional associate is applying; serving on selection or promotion committees when an individual with whom the committee member has a grievance is under consideration; or serving on a graduate committee for a family member of a close associatehttps://arp.nmsu.edu/chapter-3/3-07.html#:~:text=A%20conflict%20of%20interest%20can,way%20to%20manage%20these%20conflicts. This rule was recompiled in 2017 (formerly Rule 3.20.35)https://arp.nmsu.edu/chapter-3/3-07.html#:~:text=Revision%20History%3A.

### Full text of ARP 3.08 – Requests Made to Subordinate

To avoid conflicts between the needs of the institution and those of supervisors, persons in a position of supervisory authority may not request that subordinates perform duties that benefit the supervisor or their family if those duties are unrelated to official job responsibilities. For example, a supervisor may not ask a subordinate to nominate the supervisor for an award or to purchase items to support the supervisor’s child’s school activityhttps://arp.nmsu.edu/chapter-3/3-08.html#:~:text=In%20order%20to%20prevent%20individuals,activity%20of%20the%20supervisor%E2%80%99s%20child. This rule was recompiled in 2017 (formerly Rule 3.20.36)https://arp.nmsu.edu/chapter-3/3-08.html#:~:text=Revision%20History%3A.

This short rule prohibits individuals or organizations from conducting sales or solicitations on university property that result in personal financial gain, except as expressly permitted under the separate sales and solicitation policy (ARP 14.92). Faculty, staff, students and third‑party vendors must therefore refrain from using NMSU premises to sell goods or services for personal profithttps://arp.nmsu.edu/chapter-3/3-09.html#:~:text=3,Solicitations. The rule cross‑references ARP 14.92 for exceptions and notes that it was recompiled in 2017 from former Rule 3.20.37https://arp.nmsu.edu/chapter-3/3-09.html#:~:text=ARP%2014.92%20,Solicitation.

### Full text of ARP 3.10 – COI: Prohibitions in Procurement

This rule prohibits any member of the Board of Regents or university employee from selling supplies, equipment, services or insurance to NMSU or from receiving any commission or profit on account of such sales. Faculty, staff and regents are barred from being parties, directly or indirectly, to any contract with the universityhttps://arp.nmsu.edu/chapter-3/3-10.html#:~:text=No%20member%20of%20the%20Board,with%20all%20state%20statutes%20and. The university must comply with state statutes governing conflicts in procurement, including NMSA 1978 §§ 21‑1‑35 and 13‑1‑190, and follow guidance in Section 4 of the Business Procedures Manualhttps://arp.nmsu.edu/chapter-3/3-10.html#:~:text=contract,the%20NMSU%20Business%20Procedures%20Manual. This rule was recompiled in 2017 from former Rule 3.20.38https://arp.nmsu.edu/chapter-3/3-10.html#:~:text=Revision%20History%3A.

Actual or perceived conflicts of interest or commitment arising from externally funded projects are of special concern because they often involve entities outside the university and are subject to public scrutiny and governmental regulations. ARP 3.11 applies the general principles and definitions described in RPM 3.00 and ARP 3.02 to sponsored activities and provides additional guidancehttps://arp.nmsu.edu/chapter-3/3-11.html#:~:text=Actual%20or%20perceived%20conflicts%20of,Specific%20guidance%20on%20conflicts%20of.

**Part 1: Conflicts from Financial Interests.** Conflicts generally arise when an investigator or family member has a significant financial interest in, or consulting arrangement with, a private firm affected by the sponsored activity. Examples include hiring a business in which the investigator holds a financial stake to perform sponsored research; purchasing major equipment from such a firm; consulting for a competing firm while managing sponsored research; accepting gratuities from vendors doing business with NMSU; exploiting privileged information for personal gain; or sponsoring research at a firm where the investigator has a financial interesthttps://arp.nmsu.edu/chapter-3/3-11.html#:~:text=PART%201%3A%20CONFLICTS%20THAT%20ARISE,FROM%20FINANCIAL%20INTERESTS. Investigators must disclose and manage such conflicts.

**Part 2: Conflicts from Personal Interests.** Non‑financial conflicts may arise when an investigator or family member holds unpaid positions (e.g., board membership) with a sponsoring entity; when a family member participates in the research as a subject or researcher; or when the research validates technology developed by a family memberhttps://arp.nmsu.edu/chapter-3/3-11.html#:~:text=PART%202%3A%20CONFLICTS%20THAT%20ARISE,FROM%20PERSONAL%20INTERESTS.

**Part 3: Other Conflict Situations.** The rule acknowledges that other conflicts may develop during a project, such as neglecting university obligations due to project demands, nepotism in multidisciplinary projects or steering work to benefit family or associateshttps://arp.nmsu.edu/chapter-3/3-11.html#:~:text=It%20is%20important%20to%20realize,of%20conflict%20situations%20might%20include. Investigators must monitor projects and disclose emerging conflicts promptlyhttps://arp.nmsu.edu/chapter-3/3-11.html#:~:text=It%20is%20important%20to%20realize,of%20conflict%20situations%20might%20include.

**Part 4: Governmental Regulations.** Many sponsored projects are subject to federal conflict‑of‑interest regulations. The federal Office of Management and Budget sets general procurement standards requiring written standards of conduct and disclosure thresholds, and agencies such as the National Science Foundation and the Public Health Service impose specific disclosure and management requirementshttps://arp.nmsu.edu/chapter-3/3-11.html#:~:text=PART%204%3A%20GOVERNMENTAL%20REGULATIONS%20PERTAINING,TO%20CONFLICTS. ARP 3.11 implements these federal requirements and encourages investigators to familiarize themselves with agency‑specific ruleshttps://arp.nmsu.edu/chapter-3/3-11.html#:~:text=PART%204%3A%20GOVERNMENTAL%20REGULATIONS%20PERTAINING,TO%20CONFLICTS.

**Part 5: Duty to Disclose and Procedures.** Investigators and principal investigators must determine whether any real or potential conflict exists and indicate this on the Proposal Award Form submitted to the Office of the Vice President for Research. Potential conflicts should be resolved before the proposal is submitted; if unresolved, they must be disclosed and reviewed by the Committee on Conflicts of Interest in Sponsored Activitieshttps://arp.nmsu.edu/chapter-3/3-11.html#:~:text=PART%205%3A%20DUTY%20TO%20DISCLOSE,ACTUAL%2FPOTENTIAL%20CONFLICTS%3B%20PROCEDURES. Investigators must file annual disclosure forms and update them if new conflicts arisehttps://arp.nmsu.edu/chapter-3/3-11.html#:~:text=PART%205%3A%20DUTY%20TO%20DISCLOSE,ACTUAL%2FPOTENTIAL%20CONFLICTS%3B%20PROCEDURES. The Office of the Vice President for Research provides the forms to the committee, which reviews and manages conflicts.

The revision history notes that this rule consolidates former Rules 3.21 through 3.21.25 and was recompiled in 2017https://arp.nmsu.edu/chapter-3/3-11.html#:~:text=Revision%20History%3A.

This rule sets out procedures for reviewing and resolving conflicts of interest identified under ARP 3.11.

**Part 1: Review and Resolution.** The Committee on Conflicts of Interest in Sponsored Activities is a standing committee consisting of the vice president for research, a research center director, and three faculty members (one of whom is not involved in sponsored research). The committee meets as needed to review disclosure statements and determines whether no conflict exists, the conflict has been resolved, or an unresolved conflict remainshttps://arp.nmsu.edu/chapter-3/3-12.html#:~:text=PART%201%3A%20REVIEW%20AND%20RESOLUTION,INTEREST%20RELATING%20TO%20SPONSORED%20ACTIVITIES. When a conflict remains unresolved, the committee notifies the appropriate dean or vice president and works with the principal investigator and department to manage the conflict; acceptance of an award is delayed until the conflict is resolved. Management options include public disclosure, divestiture or blind trust arrangements, disqualification from certain duties, severance of conflicting business relationships, and independent monitoringhttps://arp.nmsu.edu/chapter-3/3-12.html#:~:text=3,affected%20activities%20by%20independent%20reviewers.

**Part 2: Appeals.** If the committee determines that a conflict cannot be remedied, the sponsored activity cannot be accepted. The principal investigator may appeal the committee’s decision to the provost and senior vice president for academic affairs, who consults with the investigator and committee and issues a final decision within 30 dayshttps://arp.nmsu.edu/chapter-3/3-12.html#:~:text=SPONSORED%20ACTIVITIES.

**Part 3: Record Retention.** The Office of the Vice President for Research maintains records of all disclosures and actions taken for at least three years after close‑out of the sponsored activity or as otherwise required by law, and the Office of Human Resource Services retains the original disclosure forms in the employee’s personnel filehttps://arp.nmsu.edu/chapter-3/3-12.html#:~:text=PART%203%3A%20RETENTION%20OF%20RECORDS,OF%20INTEREST%20IN%20SPONSORED%20ACTIVITIES. The revision history notes amendments approved in 2010 and the 2017 recompilationhttps://arp.nmsu.edu/chapter-3/3-12.html#:~:text=2,the%20employee%E2%80%99s%20official%20personnel%20file.

**Part 1: Rule Statement.** Employees with teaching, supervisory or evaluative authority must maintain professional boundaries with those they supervise or teach. Consensual romantic or sexual relationships between supervisors and subordinates or between teachers/advisors and students are strongly discouraged because they create conflicts of interest that can impair academic and employment decisions and expose the parties and the university to liabilityhttps://arp.nmsu.edu/chapter-3/3-13.html#:~:text=It%20is%20the%20Rule%20of,supervisor%20or%20advisor%20has%20the. If such a relationship develops, the person in the position of authority must disclose it to an immediate supervisor and cooperate in arranging alternate supervision or evaluationhttps://arp.nmsu.edu/chapter-3/3-13.html#:~:text=subordinates%2C%20teachers%20and%20students%2C%20and,employee%2C%20student%20or%20student%20employee.

**Part 2: Scope and Definitions.** The rule applies to all employees, including student employees. A consensual relationship is a mutually acceptable romantic or sexual relationship. A conflict of interest exists when someone who evaluates or supervises an employee or student enters a consensual relationship with that personhttps://arp.nmsu.edu/chapter-3/3-13.html#:~:text=PART%202%3A%20SCOPE.

**Part 3: Reporting and Supervisor Responsibilities.** Individuals in supervisory or instructional roles must immediately notify their supervisor about any consensual relationship and work together to remove the conflict by assigning alternate supervision, grading or advising. Supervisors must ensure that documentation of the resolution is maintainedhttps://arp.nmsu.edu/chapter-3/3-13.html#:~:text=PART%204%3A%20REPORTING%20RESPONSIBILITY.

**Part 4: Failure to Report and Grievance.** Failure to disclose or cooperate in resolving such conflicts may result in disciplinary action ranging from counseling to termination. Disciplinary actions may be grieved or appealed under existing university procedureshttps://arp.nmsu.edu/chapter-3/3-13.html#:~:text=PART%206%3A%20FAILURE%20TO%20REPORT,OR%20COOPERATE. Questions about the rule may be directed to the assistant vice president for human resource serviceshttps://arp.nmsu.edu/chapter-3/3-13.html#:~:text=PART%208%3A%20ASSISTANCE. The rule was recompiled in 2017 from former Rule 3.22https://arp.nmsu.edu/chapter-3/3-13.html#:~:text=Revision%20History%3A.

This comprehensive rule governs how undergraduate and graduate students may seek redress when they believe they have been treated unjustly by an NMSU process or person. Part 1 states that if a specific policy or rule applies to the subject matter of the grievance, that rule governs; otherwise the general grievance principles and procedures described here applyhttps://arp.nmsu.edu/chapter-5/5-05.html#:~:text=PART%201%3A%20SCOPE%20AND%20PURPOSE.

**Part 2: General Principles.** Key principles include defining “day” as a business day, allowing official correspondence by email or mail, ensuring impartiality of fact‑finders and decision makers, discouraging involvement of legal counsel in order to resolve grievances at the lowest administrative level, prohibiting retaliation for filing a grievance and emphasizing prompt resolutionhttps://arp.nmsu.edu/chapter-5/5-05.html#:~:text=PART%202%3A%C2%A0%20GENERAL%20PRINCIPLES%20APPLICABLE,TO%20ALL%20STUDENT%20GRIEVANCES. Grievance records must be retained by the dean of students or designee for a period consistent with state records regulationshttps://arp.nmsu.edu/chapter-5/5-05.html#:~:text=grievance%20process,the%20processing%20of%20the%20grievance.

**Part 4: General Student Non‑Academic Grievance Process.** If no specific process applies, students follow a four‑step procedure: 1) informal resolution at the department/unit level within ten days; 2) a written grievance to the next level administrator within ten days if informal resolution fails; 3) a final administrative appeal to the dean of students; and 4) judicial review limited to whether NMSU followed its rules and procedures. The rule provides timelines for each step and notes that grievance processes are not legal proceedingshttps://arp.nmsu.edu/chapter-5/5-05.html#:~:text=PART%203%3A%20PROCEDURES%20FOR%20SPECIFIC,TYPES%20OF%20STUDENT%20GRIEVANCES.
